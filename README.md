# 🌸 Blossom

**A lush, classless, and fully semantic CSS framework.** *An evolution of [sakura](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura) with a focus on modern semantics and fluid design.*

Blossom.css is a drop-in styling solution that transforms plain, raw HTML into a beautiful, readable document with **zero classes**. It is designed for developers who want to focus on content and semantics rather than fighting with CSS frameworks.

## 🌟 Why Blossom?

blossom builds upon the minimalist philosophy of sakura but adds modern refinements for a more "lush" reading experience:

- **Ultra Lightweight:** Under **3KB** pre-compression. It loads almost instantly, ensuring your site is lightning-fast even on slow connections.
- **Fluid Typography:** Uses CSS `clamp()` to scale text smoothly between devices—no more rigid breakpoints.
- **Lush Vertical Rhythm:** Optimized line-height (1.75) and generous spacing to give your content room to breathe.
- **Fully Semantic:** Custom, classless styling for modern tags like `<nav>`, `<details>`, `<aside>`, `<progress>`, and `<mark>`.
- **Automatic Dark Mode:** Built-in support for `prefers-color-scheme` using high-contrast CSS variables.
- **Classless Philosophy:** Just drop the CSS file in and your standard HTML tags look great immediately.
